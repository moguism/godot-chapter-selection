Imagine you're making a huge video game. So big that you separate it into chapters with a lot of content in order not to leave your fans without content for a long time.
However, **you can't put all the chapters in a single project**, since this could cause issues. Instead, **you should make independent projects and then put them together** somehow. But that's the question, how?

Recently, in _GameMaker_ they introduced a function to solve this issue thanks to Toby Fox's _DELTARUNE_, but in **_Godot Engine_** I couldn't find a practical way to deal with the problem, and that's why I decided to make this.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES: 
- **Remember to compile the main game in the project's root folder, or change the paths to the chapters in _ChapterSelect.cs_**

#### ADITIONAL NOTES
- All the projects without compilation are in the "PROJECTS" folders, in case you need them
- The compiled versions from previous commits doesn't work because I forgot to add a folder, so you'll need to compile both projects by yourself
- If you want to contribute (thanks!), you can open an Issue or a Pull Request
